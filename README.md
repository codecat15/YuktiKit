# YuktiKit

_Knowledge kit for iOS developers_

Welcome to **YuktiKit** A living, evolving wiki dedicated to iOS development best practices, architectural clarity, and engineering discipline.

**Yukti** (‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø) is a Sanskrit word meaning _logic_, _strategy_, or _clever reasoning_. This repository is a curated knowledge base for developers who care not just about building apps, but building them _well_ with intent, clarity, and maintainability.

**Stay thoughtful. Ship smart. Use your _Yukti_.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è This Is Not a Framework

This isn‚Äôt a package, SDK, or dependency **YuktiKit is a knowledge kit, a developer‚Äôs guidebook.** It won't ship to the App Store, but it will make the things you ship better.

### üìö What's Inside

This repo‚Äôs [Wiki](https://github.com/codecat15/YuktiKit/tree/main/wiki) is the heart of YuktiKit, currently containing:

- **[iOS Roadmap](https://github.com/codecat15/YuktiKit/blob/main/wiki/iOS-Roadmap.md)**  
  A structured path for iOS developers to grow from basics to advanced topics and help them crack interviews.

- **[Developer Quality Guide](https://github.com/codecat15/YuktiKit/blob/main/wiki/Developer-Quality-Guide.md)**
  What to do. What _not_ to do. Code hygiene, architectural reasoning, and battle-tested principles for writing clean, maintainable Swift.

- **[Architecture Decisions](https://github.com/codecat15/YuktiKit/blob/main/wiki/Architecture%20Patterns/Architecture-Context-Guide.md)**
  A living document that captures the guiding principles, boundaries, and reasoning behind architectural decisions. Use this as your **north star** and make changes depending on your project and usecase.

## More to come:

Including examples, architecture comparisons, and anti-pattern breakdowns.
